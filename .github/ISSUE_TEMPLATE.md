I'm a gentledev i:
- [ ] fully read the README recently
- [ ] searched for existing issues
- [ ] checked I'm up to date with the latest version of the project

### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

### Debugging informations
- `node -v` result:
```
<paste here>
```

- `npm -v` result:
```
<paste here>
```
If the result is lower than 8.10.0, there is
 poor chances we even have a look to it. Please,
 use the last [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Feature request
<!--

If you think a feature need to be added,
 your suggestions are welcome. Beware
 though that:
- we try to keep things simple so please
 ensure the requested feature is really
 related to this project. If not, you may
 instead create a module that augment/work
 with this one,
- prioritization is the key to success so
 keep calm and be aware that your request
 may stay incomplete for ever. Nothing
 impeach you to implement the feature
 and get it merged though.
